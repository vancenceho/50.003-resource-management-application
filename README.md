4. Launch backend API server  

``` shell

```

> go to `localhost:3000` to see if **Express.js** server is running  
> go to the following to view different containers: 
>> `localhost:8080` : `Swagger` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(API Documentation & Testing)
