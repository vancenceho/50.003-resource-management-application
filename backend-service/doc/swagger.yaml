  title: Dell Technologies Resource Management Application Backend API Documentation
  description: >-
    This is the backend API documentation and specifcation for the Dell Technologies Resource Management Web Application, and it is based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.


    The API is a RESTful API service which we designed and built to allow us to perform CRUD operations on data stored on a MongoDB Server.


    This application is built using the following technolgoies:

    - [React.js](https://react.dev/)

    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

    - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

    - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

    - [Swagger.io](https://swagger.io/)


    This application is built to manage resources much easier 
    and more efficiently helping the organisation to keep 
    track and manage resources more easily. 


    It is built using the MERN stack and it is a full-stack 
    application which can be easily deployed with the help 
    of Docker deployment. We also utilised React.js as a 
    frontend framework which works well with Express.js and 
    Node.js as the backend server. For the database, we have
    used MongoDB, since it is a NoSQL database, it allows 
    for much more flexibility as well as scalability.
    Lastly, for the ease of testing and documentation, we 
    have utilised Swagger.io to document our API endpoints.


    For more information about the application and usage of
    the application, please refer to the README.md file. 
    For usage of the API, please refer to the API documentation
    below.
